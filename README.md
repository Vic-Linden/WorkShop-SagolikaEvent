# School project! 🦄

This project was created during a school workshop with a focus on **HTML and CSS**, where the main goal was to practice the CSS box model (margin, border, padding, and content).

Our group chose to create a marketing website for a fictional service where you can **rent a unicorn** for events, parties, or corporate activities.
The purpose of the project was to practice layout, structure, and styling, with a small use of **JavaScript** to add a fun sparkle effect.
